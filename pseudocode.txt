// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If num modulo 2 is equal to 0:
      Display "The number is even."
   Else:
      Display "The number is odd."


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Start

2. Initialize variables:
     total = 0
     smallest = Infinity   // Set to a large value initially
     largest = -Infinity   // Set to a small value initially

3. Repeat the following steps for i = 1 to 5:
     a. Input a number (let's call it 'num')
     b. Add 'num' to 'total'
     c. If 'num' is less than 'smallest', set 'smallest' to 'num'
     d. If 'num' is greater than 'largest', set 'largest' to 'num'

4. Calculate the average:
     average = total / 5

5. Display the results:
     a. Display "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
     b. Display "The smallest number is: " + smallest
     c. Display "The largest number is: " + largest

6. End
